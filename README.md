# angular-seed â€” the seed for awesome AngularJS apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your angular webapp projects and dev environment for these
projects.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the angular-seed repository and install the dependencies:


### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the angular-seed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Clone angular-seed

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/javascript-awesome/angular-seed.git
cd angular-seed
```

If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/javascript-awesome/angular-seed.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and angular framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager][npm].
* We get the angular code via `bower`, a [client-side code package manager][bower].

We have preconfigured `npm` to automatically run `bower` so we can simply do:

```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `vendor` - contains the angular framework files

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server and [grunt][gruntjs] tasks.

To run grunt tasks you need the Grunt command line interface.

Install this globally and you'll have access to the grunt command anywhere on your system.
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```


### Starting the app in development mode

```
grunt up
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8080/`


## Other grunt tasks

### Compiling the app

```
grunt compile
```

### Starting the app in production mode

```
grunt up:compile
```

## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the project.
Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.
